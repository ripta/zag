zag :: just the zig compiler in a docker image

Even though you could just always download directly from ziglang, Docker images
are the easiest way for me to cache a copy of the zig compiler.

zig itself is released under the [MIT license][license]. You can also consider
[sponsoring][sponsoring] the Zig Software Foundation.
